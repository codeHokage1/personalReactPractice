## React.js Practice

A repo of my personal practice on React.js, following a YouTube video by Bob Ziroll. This repo contains many react apps.

So far, I've done the following projects:
* The first ReactFacts Project 
* The AirBnB Clone
* Travel Journal => [link](https://personal-react-practice.vercel.app/)
